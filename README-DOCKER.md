# iAstroHub via Docker

This README outlines how to run iAstroHub inside a Docker container. It is a work in progress and not yet fully functional.

Remaining work to be done towards this ends is:

* Dockerize iAstroHub software
* Validate Dockerized hardware control works on Raspbian
* Enable full iAstroHub deployment via AstroSwarm
